	        <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is currently the Director of the Center of Excellence for Research in Computational Intelligence and Applications, School of Computer Science, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, U.K. and also a Changjiang (Visiting) Chair Professor (Cheung Kong Scholar) with the Nature Inspired Computation and Applications Laboratory, School of Computer Science and Technology, USTC. He has given more than 50 invited keynote and plenary speeches at conferences and workshops worldwide. He has more than 300 referenced publications. His major research interests include evolutionary artificial neural networks, automatic modularization of machine learning systems, evolutionary optimization, constraint-handling techniques, computational time complexity of evolutionary algorithms, coevolution, iterated prisoner's dilemma, data mining, and realworld applications.</p>
            <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Yao was the Editor-in-Chief of the IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION from 2003 to 2008, an Associate Editor or editorial board member of 12 other journals, and the Editor of the World Scientific Book Series on Advances in Natural Computation. He was the recipient of the President's Award for Outstanding Thesis by the Chinese Academy of Sciences for his Ph.D. work on simulated annealing and evolutionary algorithms in 1989. He was the recipient of the 2001 IEEE Donald G. Fink Prize Paper Award for his work on evolutionary artificial neural networks.</p>

			<p> </p>
			<p align="justify"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abstract:</strong>Computational intelligence has been applied to software engineering for many years. This talk will review some of the recent advances in two major areas. The first one is related to ensemble learning approaches to software effort estimation and software defect prediction. Multi-objective ensemble learning for software effort estimation will be described, where different measures
(objectives) are used simultaneously to learn an ensemble with a better and more
robust accuracy [1,2]. To exploit the characteristics of software defect 
prediction problems, class imbalance learning will be introduced to emphasise
the importance of the minority class (i.e., defects) with the need to define
any cost matrix [3]. The second area to be covered in this talk is on
multi-objective optimisation for hard software engineering problems, including
software module clustering [4] and software testing resource allocation [5].
At the end of the talk, some other applications of computational intelligence
techniques in software engineering will be mentioned.</p>

His main research interests include automated reasoning, constraint solving, program analysis and test data generation. He has served on the program committee of about 60 international conferences (including ICSE, APLAS, SAT, CADE, VSTTE, etc.). He also serves on the editorial boards of several journals including the Chinese Journal of Computers, Journal of Computer Science and Technology, and Frontiers of Computer Science.</p>

		   <p align="justify"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abstract:</strong>Testing is very important in the development of high-quality software systems. A challenging problem in software testing is the design of a good test suite. In particular, how can we find a small set of test cases so as to achieve certain coverage criteria? In this talk, I shall give an overview of our work on automatic test data generation, for (1) the unit testing of C programs; (2) EFSM model-based testing; and (3) combinatorial testing. All of these works use (backtracking) search techniques. I shall also briefly describe our work on the static analysis of source code, and some bugs found by our tools.</p>

	        <p align="justify"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abstract:</strong> The GISMOE research agenda is concerned with optimising programs for non-functional properties such as speed, size, throughput, power consumption and bandwidth can be demanding. GISMOE sets out a vision for a new kind of software development environment inspired by recent results from Search Based Software Engineering (SBSE). Details of the GISMOE research agenda are provided in the extended keynote paper for the 27th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE 2012). This talk overview is a brief introduction to the approach and a description of the talk about the GISMOE agenda at the 2nd Chinese SBSE workshop in Dalian, 8th and 9th June 2013.</p>
